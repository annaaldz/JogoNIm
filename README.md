# JogoNim

## Getting Started
- This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
- Nim is a two-player game where players take turns removing objects from distinct piles. The player who removes the last object or objects from the last remaining pile wins. It requires strategic thinking to outmaneuver the opponent. Various versions exist, offering different starting setups and rules. Winning often involves forcing the opponent into a losing position.
